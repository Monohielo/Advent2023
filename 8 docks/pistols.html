        <p>After figuring out what’s going on, you head back towards the dockmaster and confront them about the operation. They swear that they aren’t really part of it; they are just paid to look the other way. You’re not sure if you believe him, but decide to let it go, if he turns over the name of the person paying him off. He says the name {{name?}}, and says that he’s a wanted person within the town, and you should check the message board for more information. The board is often updated with information that his crew uses to find him.  </p>
