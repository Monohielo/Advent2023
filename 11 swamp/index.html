        <p>It's been a few weeks since you last saw the comfort of a bed and a good mead. Camping out in the forest has been nice, certainly nicer than your cell in Stormvault, but it would be nice to settle down and find a small farm to live out your days. Unfortunately, when you decided to stop pursuing these gems, the visions became so intense, that you were no longer able to sleep. You'd lie in bed, your eyes would close, and you'd have a vision. When you woke up, it was morning, but felt like seconds had elapsed. It only took 3 nights before you resumed the quest. Your companions have stuck with you, though you're not really sure why. Maybe they are feeling a similar drive to the one that you are feeling.</p> 
        <p>You start heading down a small ridge, when you see it before you. A small patch of marsh, that surely means you're getting closer to your destination.  </p>
