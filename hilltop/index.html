        <p>You trudge deeper into the marsh and eventually come to a small hillock, rising about 30-40 feet higher than the rest of the land around you. As you climb up, you begin to see the ruins of some long-forgotten civilization. Broken steps and fallen handrails, shattered bits of ancient columns, and eventually, a detailed set of ruins splayed on a tablet made of a strange black stone.   </p> 
        <img src="runes.png" alt="bulletin board" width="100%">
        <p>Nearby you see a golem standing on a pedestal with swords. Made from the same black stone, it looks like this statue is the only thing untouched by age. Carved across the chest of the golem, you see the following:</p> 
        <p></p>
        <p>    The treasure you seek is deep inside </p>
        <p>    Though easy prey you will not find  </p>
        <p>    Battle smartly and keep your pride  </p>
        <p>    But first you must exercise the mind </p> 
        <p> </p>            
        <p>    The rune you seek does not curve lines  </p>
        <p>    But go diagonally, so you can slide </p> 
        <p>    And not too many, no more than five  </p>
        <p>    Though it's also taller than it is wide  </p>
        <p></p>    
        <p>    Parallel lines define its hallmark style  </p>
        <p>    More small markings make the golem hostile </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>As you finish reading the poem, you can't stop your hand from reaching out and touching one of the runes, even as Ellel and Sharash try to pull your arm away.</p>
