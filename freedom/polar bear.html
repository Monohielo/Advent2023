        <p>As you're trying to catch your breath after killing the bear, you notice the small gem in your bag pulling you towards a nearby rock. Sharash notices you circling the rock and points out a patch of ground that seems more recently disturbed. Curious as to why the gem pulled you, and excited to see if there is another one, you start digging in the dirt. With thoughts of what you can do with two powerful gems dancing in your head, you pull a small adorned chest from the ground.</p>
        <p>You hold your breath as you open the chest, and you are excited to see that it does contain another gem, but this one is a cube, rather than a triangle.  You can't wait to see what this means.</p>
        <p>With your safety finally secure, you head back to your makeshift bed and finally, finally fall asleep. However, it seems like the day is not quite done with you. As you drift off to sleep, you have a dream, more vivid than any you’ve ever had. 
        <p>You see a cult of duergar chanting around a pillar holding 6 small shapes.</p> 
        <p>Your vision slides as another view comes into focus. Another small ornate chest. Your vision quickly pulls back, and you can barely make out a signpost that reads Padsted as you soar into the air. You’re being pulled northwards, sliding past the lake of northern Fendal as you see the world in a way you’ve only imagined. The vision pulls you forward, and just off in the distance, you can see the prison that you recently left. You barely recognize it, however, due to the damage, and it’s then that the vision pulls downward, quickly, until it crashes directly into your head.</p> 
        <p>You awake with a start, just as the morning light begins to peek into the cave entrance.</p>
