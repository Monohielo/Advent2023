        <p>Before leaving the gnomes, they thank you for the company, and give you directions to an area nearby, a river that supposedly contains the remains of armor and weapons from a long-ago battle. The pieces of equipment have been scattered for quite a while, and are likely hard to find, but they walked away with a few quality pieces that they hope to sell, and if youâ€™re lucky, you may be able to find some as well.</p> 
        <p>They pack up their gear, and head on their way, while you continue ahead to the river. </p>
