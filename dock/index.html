        <p>As you head down to the docks, you find yourself overwhelmed by the size and variety of ships. A collection of trading vessels, fishing boats, and cargo barges line the docks. Each with large masts and sails in a variety of colors.</p> 

        <p>A young deckhand catches your eye, simply because he seems to be standing next to some large figures of dragons and merpeople, all elaborately painted and carved. Your attention clearly has him flustered. "Umm, um.  Hello sirs," he stammers as you approach. "What can I help you with?"</p>
            
        <p>You inquire about the figures behind him, and his cheek flush. "Oh, um. I'm supposed to be attaching these back to the boats, but these instructions are just too complicated for me. Do they make any sense to you?"</p>
            
        <p>You read over the notes, and offer to help - in exchange for passage on a ship of your choosing. </p>
