        <p>You were able to find a captain willing to take his crew on a trip to the islands, with the promise of a share of the treasure you might find.  Before he is ready to set sail though, he wants to be a little more prepared.  He knows of a room that is used to store goods that have been "reclaimed" from various sailing groups.</p>
        <p>He asks that you and your friends make into the room and find anything that might be useful in future battles.</p>
        <p>Following his directions, you find the door, with is curiously inset with 6 small shelves.  There are some gems on the shelves, but there are far more gems in a pile nearby.  Below the shelves is a series of the 6 colored gems - white, red, yellow, green, blue and orange. Upon a closer investigation, it looks like the gems under the shelves can be pushed in slightly, but not removed.
