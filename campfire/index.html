        <p>It's been 3 solid days of rain, and there's no end in sight. The only relief you've had is finding a few clusters of trees, some of them still hanging on to most of their leaves. Your trek through the swamps has been otherwise uneventful, when you spot a bit of smoke up ahead, about the same size as a campfire would make.</p> 
        <p>You approach cautiously and find a small group of gnomes huddled around a fire with a pot of delicious smelling stew sitting above it. You want to be more careful, but the growling of your stomach gives you away, as 2 of the gnomes look in your direction. They invite you to come sit but tell you that you need to solve a riddle first, otherwise, you'll need to move on. </p>
        <p>They hand you 16 pieces of parchment, each with a word on them, and tell you to put them into groups.</p>

        <h1>What's the biggest 4 digit number you can make with the groups?</h1>
