        <p> You spend the next couple hours making your way through tunnels and rooms, finding it odd, that your journey started in a cave deep underground in a dungeon, and here you are months later deep underground in another dungeon. Such is life, you guess.</p>
        <p>Up ahead, you see large door, and nearby a glowing source of power and a series of knobs and tubes leading to - well, you're not quite sure. But it's the next thing in between you and what you're confident is the last power crystal.</p>
