        <p>You awake to the sound of the prison door opening, and the sounds of a new cellmate being tossed in. The air is chilly, as always, and you roll over and try to fall back asleep. The guard standing at the doorway seems to have other plans, however. A grizzled voice calls out “I want you lot up and ready to go in 30 minutes. We are running out of cells, and you’ll be put to work cleaning out some of the old storage rooms on the lower level to make some space. Don’t make me wake you up, the water’s especially cold today.”</p>
        <p>You roll over, toss the blanket to the end of the bed, and sit up. Another day in the frozen prison of Stormvault. Great. At least this time you’ll be out of the cell for a bit, and who knows, maybe it’s warmer in the basement. Another guard comes by about 10 minutes later with breakfast, which you eat as quickly as you can. No one has spoken to each other yet, and it looks like the new cellmate is having some issues with the food.</p>
        <p>You finish breakfast just in time for the first guard to come back and lead you down the stairs. 15 flights down, where the air gets musty, and, while technically warmer, still not quite warm. He points you to a series of rooms down a hallway and gives you instructions on where to put the items. Trash in room -701, furniture in room -702, etc. You get to work, still in silence.</p>
        <p>An hour later, and you’re no longer feeling the cold. In fact, it’s starting to feel good to work your muscles again after almost 4 months in jail. You’re almost able to forget that you’re in jail, harkening back to your time spent unloading a cargo hold on the docks, down in the lower decks of a musty ship. </p>
        <p>“From the fifth head of Tiamat, what the hells is this?!” Your revery breaks as a shout echoes through the hall. You poke your head out and see the dragonborn and aarakocra looking around, just as bewildered. You walk down the hallway towards the new guy, all the way at the last cell.</p>
        <p>“What’s going on here – “You stop, as you see the warlock holding a small ornate chest, covered with jewels. They quickly turn, trying to hide it, but it’s too late. You’ve all seen it. “Ok, just keep it quiet now. We know, but there’s no reason to alert the guards. Where did you find it?” you ask.</p>
        <p>“Ugh. Fine. It was over here, hidden in a crevasse in the wall.” He points to a dark corner that looks to have experienced some sort of cave-in. Interesting, as it doesn’t appear to have been part of the original construction of the prison. Something tells you that this area is much older. You turn your attention back to the chest and see the 3 of them fiddling with the lock.</p>
        <p>“I have some experience with this.” You say, as you walk up to try and open it.</p>
