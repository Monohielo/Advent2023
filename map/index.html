        <p>After identifying a captain willing to take you out to sea, you decide to put some effort into identifying exactly where you're supposed to be going. After searching several shops for maps of the island, the best you're able to come up with is a bunch of scraps of paper - none of which actually show you the entire island, or if there are ruins. </p>

        <p>Unfortunately, it's the best you've got, so you try to work with it.  </p>
