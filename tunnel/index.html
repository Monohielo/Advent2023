        <p>As you move forward, the air gets both crisper, and colder. You must be nearing the exit. You enter a long corridor with an impressive display of runes and images on the floor. You quickly figure out that this must be part of the security system. One wrong step will likely lead to your certain death, or at least a grievous wound.</p>
        <p>You look around, and see a set of instructions engraved in a column, completely invisible from the other side of the room. Looks like getting out is going to be a lot easier than if you were trying to get in.</p>
