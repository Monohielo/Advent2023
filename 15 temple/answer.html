        <p>As the golem crashes to the ground, its body starts crumbling to dust and large chunks of rock and dirt fall away. Nestled somewhere where the torso used to be, you see a familiar chest - small, ornate, and otherwise unassuming. You open to find yet another of the gems you've been searching for. As you touch it, your vision shifts rapidly, more urgently than ever before.</p> 

        <p>You see the ocean all around you, with a few small islands in the distance. You look down to see that you're standing on a cliff, atop a small atoll in the middle of the ocean. No signs of civilization to be found. You try to memorize as much as you can before the vision pulls back. You can just make out a cluster of 5 islands before your vision pulls you back towards your body. North this time, over large stretches of land before finally reaching your location, slamming into your collapsed body on the ground.</p> 
            
        <p>You gasp and look around the small campsite your party put together. “We're going to need a boat,” you say. </p>
