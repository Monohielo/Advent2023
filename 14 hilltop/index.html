        <p>You trudge deeper into the marsh and eventually come to a small hillock, rising about 30-40 feet higher than the rest of the land around you. As you climb up, you begin to see the ruins of some long-forgotten civilization. Broken steps and fallen handrails, shattered bits of ancient columns, and eventually, a detailed set of ruins splayed on a tablet made of a strange black stone. Nearby you see a golem, also made of the same strange black stone. Carved across its chest, you see the following: 
        <p></p>
        <p>    The treasure you seek is deep inside. </p>
        <p>    Though easy prey you will not find.  </p>
        <p>    Battle smartly and keep your pride.  </p>
        <p>    But first you must exercise the mind. </p> 
        <p> </p>            
        <p>    The rune you seek does not curve lines  </p>
        <p>    But go diagonally, so you can slide </p> 
        <p>    And not too many, no more than five  </p>
        <p>    though it's also taller than it is wide  </p>
        <p></p>    
        <p>    Parallel lines define itâ€™s hallmark style  </p>
        <p>    More small markings make the golem hostile </p>
