        <p>As you prepare to head out again looking for the chest, the innkeeper comes up to you with a very concerned look on his face. It seems like the package that you informed him about was delivered late last night – an ornate carpet that had been draped over his fence. Unfortunately, his pet cat had shredded the carpet while sharpening its claws, and if he doesn’t get it repaired, he’s going to have to pay for it out of his own funds. And he doesn’t have the funds. </p>
