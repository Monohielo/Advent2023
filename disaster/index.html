        <p>After what seems like a slow week in town, you're finally out on the open ocean - salty air, beating sun, and strong winds drive you towards your destination with ease. In fact, the next 2 weeks are among the most relaxing you've had in, well, almost as long as you can remember. You take the time to catch up on some sleep, relax, sing, chat, and gamble with the crew. It's about as close as you've ever gotten to a tropical vacation.</p> 

        <p>Which is why you find it so strange to wake up with he sea lapping at your feet and your face buried into some sand with a crab picking at your fingertips. You jolt up, look around, and are glad to see Ellel and Sharash are nearby and getting to their feet. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like all of the crew made it, as a few other bodies are floating nearby. </p>
            
        <p>You sit down, and try to process what happened last night, each of you adding a bit more detail to the story.</p>
