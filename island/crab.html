        <p>As you pick up the last gem, your vision fades again, but this time, you don't collapse. You see the final ornate chest, sitting in a dimly lit room. Furniture lines the walls, but not of a style that you're familiar with. It was clearly a very well taken care of location - at least it was hundreds of years ago. Thick dust now covers most everything in the room. Your vision begins to pull back, but rather than scanning across the world, it pulls straight through the ground and up to your head. </p> 

        <p>You're close. Very close.</p>  
            
        <p></p>Dangerously close. </p>
